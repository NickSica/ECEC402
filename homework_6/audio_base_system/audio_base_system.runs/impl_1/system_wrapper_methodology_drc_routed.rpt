2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
HPDR-2#1 Warning
Port pin INOUT inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) system_i/axi_i2s_adi_0/S_AXI_AWREADY direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (system_i/S_AXI_AWREADY) connected to this hierarchical pin/port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-2#2 Warning
Port pin INOUT inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) system_i/axi_i2s_adi_0/S_AXI_BVALID direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (system_i/S_AXI_BVALID) connected to this hierarchical pin/port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-2#3 Warning
Port pin INOUT inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) system_i/axi_i2s_adi_0/S_AXI_WREADY direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (system_i/S_AXI_WREADY) connected to this hierarchical pin/port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>
